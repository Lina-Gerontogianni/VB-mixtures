# VBmixtures

Model-based clustering by Dirichlet Process or Finite Mixture models

Four model types are coded: Gaussian mixtures, Beta, Binomial and Poisson. Each section provides:
- simulator of mixture data
- initialisation of the variational algorithm
- the main variational algorithm

The discriminative accuraccy measure and the forward selection algorithm to compute it is also given for the Beta model. It can be modified accordingly for each model type.
